I've had the wonderful opportunity to share my early journey through several TedX events, including TedXManipal and TedXRamjasCollege. On this page, I have carefully curated and added the videos of these inspiring talks for you to enjoy. I hope they not only entertain you but also ignite a spark of inspiration within you.

By participating in these TedX events, I was able to connect with diverse audiences and share my unique experiences, insights, and ideas. It was a platform where I had the privilege of sharing my journey, discussing topics close to my heart, and exploring new perspectives.

I believe that watching these talks can be a source of motivation and empowerment for individuals from all walks of life. Each video encapsulates a different aspect of my journey, providing glimpses into the challenges I faced, the lessons I learned, and the growth I experienced along the way.

I invite you to take a moment to dive into these captivating videos. Join me on this immersive journey as I unravel my thoughts, ideas, and stories, all aimed at inspiring and empowering others.
