I started my journey of visiting national parks during Fall 2021, and I instantly fell in love with the scenic views and the beauty of stars. One visit lead to another, and by now I have visited 10 out of 63 national parks. I know a long way to go but will make it soon. 

I love the challenge of the trek to get the pleasure of breathtaking views and also the fun of getting to see random scenic views on the way to the top. Above all, the twinkling stars in the night takes away all the worries surrounding the life. 

In this page, I gonna post some of my pictures from the national parks to take you along my journey.
