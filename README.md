## Contributing to the Blog

Feel free to send a pull request contributing to the blogposts in my personal website. All blogposts are located in `_posts`, which are arranged according to date. Images are typically located in `assets`.

## Forking the Website

Feel free to fork the website. It's the default Jekyll template with minor CSS modification. However, make sure you edit the analytics ID in [`_includes/analytics.html`](_includes/analytics.html) so that your website's views are not logged into my account.
